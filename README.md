# petiteQueue

A stupid and brutal **job/worker system** library only using Sqlite.<br>
Lightly inpired by <a href="https://github.com/josegonzalez/php-queuesadilla">php-queuesadilla</a><br><br>
<br>
**Security** : Never expose this lib on /webroot directory, it was no coded for that. Keep it in no browsable dir.

I don't care about PSR.  🤷‍♂️

$myQueue->push('myFunction', ['some','args'])
$myQueue->push('MyClass::staticMethod', ['some','args'])
$myQueue->push(['MyClass','method'], ['some','args'])

$myQueue->jobs() // list waiting jobs
$myQueue->run() // run All jobs
